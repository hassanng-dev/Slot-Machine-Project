Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

HOW ITS MADE:
In this project I used these three languages. I used HTML to add mark up content. I used CSS to position each element in a specific place. In order for the project to resememble a casino slot machine I used numerous JavaScript functions. With the functions I was able to make the buttons work once they are clicked the game will began and the slots will randomize. Out of 5 selections in each reel if they all match with each other then you win a prize. You can continue playing the game until the the amount of money you started with is less than the amount of money you are trying to bet. If your current amount of money is less than the amount you are trying to bet then you will recieve a prompt that states "Go Home!"

Lessons Learned:
I've learned how to use JavaScript functions and understand the different ways to impliment it in various projects.
